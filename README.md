           Diabetes type 2 Detector.

  Diabetes type 2 is a chronic condition characterized by high blood sugar levels and insulin resistance. 
  It is a growing health concern worldwide, with an estimated 463 million people living with diabetes in 2019, 
  and this number is expected to rise to 700 million by 2045. 
  
  Early detection and management of diabetes type 2 is crucial for preventing serious complications 
  such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. 
  
  In this project, we aim to analyze a dataset of various health parameters to predict 
  the likelihood of an individual developing type 2 diabetes. 
 
  By utilizing machine learning techniques, we hope to create a predictive model that can aid in the early detection 
  and prevention of this disease. This project can potentially make a significant impact in the healthcare field, 
  providing valuable insights and potentially improving the lives of millions of individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes.
